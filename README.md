# An Empirical Research Study on the Efficacy of Pattern Matching Algorithms in the Arabic Language
In Natural Language Processing, there are numerous applications for searching information in texts across different languages 
around the world. However, for Arabic, this is rare due to the complexity of its processing and its unique characteristics.<br>The goal of this project is to solve the problem of information search in Arabic texts, regardless of the presence of 
diacritical symbols. This platform uses Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing algorithms to not only to allow 
the user to easily search for information in Arabic texts, but also to determine how often it occurs and precisely locate it 
within the text.
