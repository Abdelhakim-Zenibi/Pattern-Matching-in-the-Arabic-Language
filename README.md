# An Empirical Research Study on the Efficacy of Pattern Matching Algorithms in the Arabic Language

In Natural Language Processing, there are numerous applications for searching information in texts across different 
languages around the world. However, for Arabic, this is rare due to the complexity of its processing and its unique 
characteristics 
<br>The goal of this project is to solve the problem of information search in Arabic texts, regardless of the presence of 
diacritical symbols. This platform uses Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing algorithms to not only to 
allow the user to easily search for information in Arabic texts, but also to determine how often it occurs and precisely 
locate it within the text.

## Some Algorithms and Methods Used

The project uses various algorithms and methods for pattern matching in the Arabic language, including: 

- Pattern Matching Algorithm
- Token Count Vectorizer
- Arabic shakeel Function
- Strip_shakeel Function

## Tools and Dependencies

The project is written using Java, J2EE, Apache Tomcat, HTML5, CSS3, JS, MYSQL.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of using Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing algorithms for
search in Arabic texts, regardless of the presence of diacritical symbols. The different algorithms and methods used in the 
project provide a comprehensive approach to easily search for information in Arabic texts, but also to determine how often 
it occurs and precisely locate it within the text.
